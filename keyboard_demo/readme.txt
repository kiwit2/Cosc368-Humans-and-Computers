To Run:
$ ./keyboard.py

To Change Settings (e.g. different keyboard layouts):
* Open keyboard.py
* Modify the MODE="..." lines to change which keyboard is used



To Compile/Update this Bundle:
* Grab the keyboard_src.zip bundle
* Run keyboard.py, to generate the .pyc file for keyboard_impl.py
* Copy the __pycache__/keyboard_impl.[*].pyc  file (where "[*]" will be some string representing the python interpreter version) and put it alongside keyboard_impl.py and keyboard.py.
* Zip up the keyboard.py and keyboard_impl.pyc files into "keyboard.zip", along with this messsage.
